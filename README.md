# BD-1 Voice Assistant Project

Welcome to the **BD-1 Voice Assistant Project**! ðŸŽ§ðŸ¤–

This repository aims to build a custom **Text-to-Speech (TTS) system** that mimics the vocal style of **BD-1**, the adorable droid from *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*. The TTS reacts to user input using pre-recorded BD-1 sounds that are matched to emotion and sentence structure.

![BD-1 Sound Project](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Shcaq2sc_Ovxg0BefIrLsAHaLO?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)

> **Work in Progress:** The TTS core is functional. Emotion detection and assistant logic are under improvement.

---

## Project Goal

To build a **TTS system in BD-1's style**, capable of:
- Responding to user prompts using a combination of **BD-1 sounds**.
- Matching **emotion** (e.g. happy, sad, surprised) to the content of the phrase.
- **Mimicking language structure** while remaining robotic and cute.


---
## Before starting

pydub seems to have dependencies that do not work with Python 3.13. I provide a fix_pydub.py to run before doing anything.

---

## Current To-Do List

Here's what's left:

- Improve **emotion detection** from text input. (see `assign_emotion()` function)
- Test different styles and expressions with **more BD-1 phrases**.
- Find a way to make BD-1's sentence shorter and keeping a "grammatical" sens

## Functional Breakdown (text_to_speech_vX.py)

### tts_bd1(message: str)
  Main entry point to play a complete BD-1 response.

  - Splits full message into emotional phrases
  - Calls generate_tts_audio() per phrase
  - Assembles and plays final audio

### process_message_by_phrases(message: str)
  Splits the text into short sentences using ., !, ? and detects emotion per phrase.

  - Returns a list of (phrase, emotion).
  - assign_emotion(phrase: str)

  Rules-based emotion classifier:
  |            Keyword         | Emotion                      |
  |----------------------------|------------------------------|
  |      **?**                 | Question                     |
  |      **!**                 | Surprise                     |
  | **Keywords like non**      | negatif                      |
  | **Keywords like oui**      | positif                      |
  | **Keywords like triste**   | triste (sad)                 |
  |        **Else**            | neutre (neutral)             |



### decompose_message(message: str)
  Extracts consonants by syllable:
  - Removes vowels and accents
  - Only keeps consonants followed by vowels
  - Groups leading consonants (e.g. dr, gn, mp)
  - Discards words of length â‰¤ 4 unless exception. If no word over 4 letters, accepts 4 letters words.
  - Returns a cleaned list of consonants.

### map_letters_to_sound_groups(text: list[str])
  Converts consonants to families:
  - B = Beep
  - S = Sifflement (whistle)
  - P = Piano

### get_sound_chunked(consonnes, emotion)
  Core of audio matching logic.
  - Tries longest chunks (4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 1)
  - Uses folders like:
  - sounds/compositions/3_caracteres/Beep Piano Sifflement/positif
    Fallback:
    - Same chunk in neutre
    - Then letter-level fallback with ### get_sound()
  - Ensures no .wav is used twice
  - Returns list of (path, emotion, chunk_length, original_chars)
  - CURRENT VERSION each word is limited to one chunk or character to avoid long message

### get_sound(consonne, emotion)
  Fallback sound lookup:
  - Tries in sounds/emotions/{emotion}/
  - If not found, tries sounds/consonnes/ (Neutral sound folder)

### generate_tts_audio(message: str, options)
  Assembles final audio from selected chunks:
  - Uses AudioSegment.from_wav
  - Displays full table of sound matches
  - Returns in-memory WAV file

##  What Happens Step-by-Step

Suppose the message is:

"Bonjour Ã  toi ! Comment vas-tu ?"

1. tts_bd1() calls process_message_by_phrases()
  Breaks into:
  - Phrase 1: "Bonjour Ã  toi !" â†’ surprise
  - Phrase 2: "Comment vas-tu ?" â†’ question

2. For each phrase:
  generate_tts_audio() is called

3. decompose_message() extracts consonants
  Keeps only relevant syllables :
  - ['b', 'n', 'j', ' '] ignore other words (too small)
  - ['c', 'm', 'm', ' '] ignore other words (too small)

4. map_letters_to_sound_groups() is called
  Convert letters to sound group to find chunks :
  - ['b', 'n', 'j', ' '] => ['B', 'P', 'S', ' ']
  - ['c', 'm', 'm', ' '] => ['B', 'P', 'P', ' ']

5. get_sound_chunked() looks for sound files
- Tries biggest matching chunk (4 to 1) => not applicable here
- Fallback to three
- first cherche for BPS (Beep, Piano, Sifflement) with surprise tone
- No surprise tone => Fallback to neutral and find neutral.

- Looks for Beep Piano Piano then
- Fallback to Beep Piano neutral

5. Files are combined
  With pydub.AudioSegment, then played with simpleaudio
